# open-gpt-core
GPT From Scratch — A fully-documented PyTorch implementation of GPT built line-by-line, without shortcuts. This project walks through the core mechanics of Transformers — from Multi-Head Attention and Layer Normalization to Feed-Forward Networks and Causal Masking — culminating in a working GPT-style text generator.
